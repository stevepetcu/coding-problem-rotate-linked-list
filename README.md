## Problem Statement

Given a linked list and a positive integer `k`, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

For example, given the linked list `7 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5` and `k = 2`, it should become `3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 7`.

Given the linked list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` and `k = 3`, it should become `3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2`.

> Note: we are making some assumptions:
> 1. k should always be >= 0
> 1. if k is < 0 or == 0, we'll return the list unchanged
